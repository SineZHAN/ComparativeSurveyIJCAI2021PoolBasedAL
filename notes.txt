1. In newest ALiPy version, they have canceled the implementation of BMDR, SPAL and LAL for multi-class classification, if someone really want to run these experiments, please contact me or directly using the ALiPy version before 2020.

2. If someone meet the error about "scipy.sparse.linalg.eigen.arpack.arpack", please revise the code of [your library path]/cvxpy/expressions/constants/constant.py:

from: "from scipy.sparse.linalg.eigen.arpack.arpack import ArpackError"
to: "from scipy.sparse.linalg import ArpackError"

3. if someone meet the Error report on EER, please revise the code of [your library path]/alipy/query_strategy/query_labels.py line 710

from: score.append(pv[i, yi] * self.log_loss(prob))
to: score.append(pv[i, int(yi)] * self.log_loss(prob))

If the questions is about multi-class classification tasks: please add new code after line 706
Add: if min(classes)>0:
        yi = yi-1
